<!-- more -->

<p>We’ve all experienced this feeling: <em>I have no idea how many modules will be in this block, but I would love to lay them out differently depending on that number.</em> Short of writing exhaustive CSS to (hopefully, optimistically) cover all of your bases, we had not figured out a good way to do this.</p>

<p>Heydon to the rescue!</p>

<p>Here’s Heydon’s first quantity query example:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/eddda1f32ed102cedd86.js?file=equal.css'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>li:nth-last-child(6):first-child, 
li:nth-last-child(6):first-child ~ li {
  color: green;
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>With these selectors, the rule set would only apply if the total count of list items was exactly 6. Here’s what he is selecting:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A list item (<code>li</code>) that is 6th sibling in a group of list item siblings when counted backwards (<code>:nth-last-child(6)</code>), but only if it is also the first of those siblings (<code>:first-child</code>); and</li>
  <li>Any list item (<code>li</code>) siblings that follow the one selected above (<code>~</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Brilliant! <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/quantity-queries-for-css#section4">Heydon breaks it down way more eloquently</a> (and with illustrated squid to boot). To use this in your own projects, simply swap the “6” for whatever count you are looking for it to be equal to.</p>

<p>But Heydon doesn’t stop there. He also gives us ways to test for  more than or equal to and fewer than or equal to a certain number. We’ll start with the <br />
“more than” variant (because everyone always wants more):</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/eddda1f32ed102cedd86.js?file=more-than-or-equal.css'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>li:nth-last-child(n+6),
li:nth-last-child(n+6) ~ li {
  /* properties here */
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This one is slightly more complex, using the <code>nth-*</code> formula to manage the calculation. In English, this selects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A list item (<code>li</code>) which is the sixth, seventh, eighth, etc. sibling in a collection of list item siblings when counted backwards from the end of that collection (<code>:nth-last-child(n+6)</code>); and</li>
  <li>Any list item (<code>li</code>) siblings that follow the one(s) selected above (<code>~</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>The magic is in the formula: <em>n+6</em>.</p>

<p>The way <code>nth-*</code> formulae work is that the “n” portion is about dividing the siblings into smaller groups based on the <em>n</em> multiplier. So “2n” means for every group of 2, “3n” means for every group of 3, and so on. In Heydon’s case, “n” simply means for every group of 1. The <em>n</em> multiplier starts as zero (for the first group) and then becomes 1, 2, 3, etc. in succession.</p>

<p>The number added or subtracted from this number (“+6” in the example) can be though of as the item in the count. Most often we see this in use as “2n+2” which stands for the second sibling in every group of two. It’s usually common to see this number be smaller than the grouping number (“3n+2”, “5n+3”, etc.). In Heydon’s example, however there is no grouping, so that logic doesn’t really apply. Instead you can think of it as simply adding the multiplier to 6: 0+6 (6), 1+6 (7), 2+6 (8), etc.</p>

<p>Now count from the end and then select that and everything that follows and you get a “more than or equal to” count based on the number (6 in his case, but again you can swap it out). Brilliant!</p>

<p>The final example he gives is for fewer than or equal to a particular number:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/eddda1f32ed102cedd86.js?file=fewer-than-or-equal.css'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>li:nth-last-child(-n+6):first-child,
li:nth-last-child(-n+6):first-child ~ li {
  /* properties here */
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This one is largely the same as the “more than” example, but the multiplier is reversed (with the minus sign) which means the count runs backward: 0+6 (6), -1+5 (5), -2+6 (4), and so on.</p>

<p>I am just overjoyed with how brilliant this is. I can think of so many places to use it (and will likely be doing so quite soon).</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/danielguillan">Daniel Guillan</a> has <a href="https://github.com/danielguillan/quantity-queries">ported this functionality (and more) to SASS</a> using a handful of really straightforward mixins. Here’s a demo:</p>
