    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to spend Tuesday in Nashville for An Event Apart (for reasons that will be revealed in about a month), but I did catch Monday and it was amazing.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The esteemed <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> kicked the day off with a talk entitled <em>Designing with Web Standards in 2016</em>. A theme he touched on repeatedly was that none of the problems we are facing in web design today are new problems. It’s a topic near and dear to my heart, something I wrote about in the closing chapter of <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/"><cite>Adaptive Web Design’s</cite> Second Edition</a> and <a href="/notebook/learn-from-the-past-enhance-for-the-future/">recently spoke about at EnhanceConf in London</a>. He knocked this one out of the park and my head was nodding so much my neck began to hurt.</p>

<p>Next up was <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/">my former WaSP colleague</a> <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew</a> to give us the skinny on CSS Grid Layouts. This is an amazing spec that I’ve always struggled to understand fully (despite the fact that’s i’ve written a Javascript polyfill for it). Rachel made it crystal clear and got me very excited about the future of layout on the Web.</p>

<p><a href="http://jensimmons.com/">Jen Simmons</a> dropped some serious CSS-related design knowledge bombs that perfectly complimented Rachel’s talk. She discussed Flexbox, CSS Shapes, Multi-column layout, viewport units and more, demonstrating how they can be used right now to progressively enhance the design of your sites.</p>

<p>After lunch, <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> took to the stage to talk about Style Guides. I only caught the last half—I’ll admit to doing some last-minute rehearsing in the hallway—but the bits I did catch were good. I’ve seen his Atomic Design talk a few times, which this one builds on. In this talk he touches on a lot of the atomic design concepts, but he also talked a lot more about workflow and the role of the front-end developer. No doubt the evolution of this talk has come in large part through writing <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">a book on Atomic Design</a> and in hosting <a href="http://styleguides.io/podcast/">a podcast with Anna Debenham on website style guides</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I was given the opportunity to share some thoughts and advice on designing and building. My talk, <em>The Features of Highly Effective Forms</em>, evolved out of several earlier talks on building forms. With this one, I wanted to strike a little more balance between the nuts and bolts of building forms and the hows and whys of building better forms.</p>

<p>The deck, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/the-features-of-highly-effective-forms-an-event-apart-nashville-2016">which I’ve posted to SlideShare</a>, doesn’t stand on its own quite as well as some of my other forms decks simply because the talk contained a lot of storytelling I chose not to pair with slides—instead opting for an black screen so folks could focus—but I did call out the salient points. I’ve begun writing up some of the recommendations as part of my <a href="/notebook/tags/web-forms/">Modern Web Forms Best Practices series</a> and will continue to do so in the future. And one of the stories I told, which I highly recommend you check out, had to do with <a href="/notebook/consider-how-your-forms-read/">a lesson Facebook learned in managing how users report offensive photos</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a> wrapped the day up with a discussion of the future of interface as things move from digital back to physical. He talked about a lot of really cool new tech that has me excited about the future, including <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">the Physical Web</a>, which Josh had running as a live demo. I wonder if anyone noticed I had a beacon running too ;-)</p>

<p>All in all, day one was a blast. As always, Jeffrey, Eric, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/toby-malina-6247a028">Toby</a>, and <a href="http://www.escapadeproductions.com/">Marci</a> do an awesome job programming their events. I’m really bummed I could not stick around to see <a href="http://valhead.com/">Val</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/grigs">Jason</a>, <a href="http://www.kryshiggins.com/">Krystal</a>, <a href="http://meyerweb.com/">Eric</a>, <a href="http://braintraffic.com/">Kristina</a>, and <a href="http://cameronmoll.com/">Cameron</a> rock it out though. I’m sure it was amazing.</p>

<p>You can check out attendees thoughts from the event by <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23aeansh&amp;src=typd">searching Twitter using the #aeansh hashtag</a>. I’ve <a href="https://storify.com/AaronGustafson/reactions-and-takeaways-from-my-aeansh-talk">collected reactions to my talk on Storify</a> for posterity as well.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/affirming-user-choice-with-checkboxes/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-06T14:24:31-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/affirming-user-choice-with-checkboxes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Checkbox” form controls have long been a part of software. They enable users to provide a simple binary response—yes or no. On the Web, we often see them in two scenarios: confirmations and multiple choice.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="confirmation-checkboxes">Confirmation Checkboxes</h2>

<p>Standalone checkboxes are often employed to enable users to affirm a statement, as in <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-01">this example</a> from <a href="https://online.americanexpress.com/myca/logon/us/action/LogonHandler?request_type=LogonHandler&amp;Face=en_US#lilo_loginForm">the American Express login form</a> where a customer can indicate they’d like the site to remember them.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-01" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>American Express’ login form offers users the option of being remembered. As that is a binary choice (e.g. yes or no), the checkbox makes sense.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here’s a simplification of the markup they’re using:</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=american-express-login-simplified.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot;&gt;
&lt;label for=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot;&gt;Remember Me&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This works really well, though I generally prefer to <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/labeled-with-love/#an-alternate-approach">combine explicit and implicit labeling</a> to simplify my CSS selectors and broaden their applicability. Here’s how I would rewrite this control:</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=american-express-login-reimagined.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;label for=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot;&gt;
  Remember Me
&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Regardless of the markup pattern itself, it’s important to note the explicit association of the form control and the <code>label</code> element (using the <code>for</code> attribute). You’ll also notice the input has a straightforward <code>name</code> value which will be submitted to the back end if the user ticks the box.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that some back-end systems may require a value be submitted for the given variable name (in this case, “REMEMBERME”) regardless of whether the user has ticked the checkbox. If that’s a requirement, you can alter the pattern to use a hidden <code>input</code> as well:</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=american-express-login-with-hidden.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot; value=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot; name=&quot;REMEMBERME&quot; value=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;label for=&quot;lilo_checkBox&quot;&gt;Remember Me&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>The source order matters because with matching <code>name</code> values, the final submittable <code>value</code> will always be the one the back-end receives. With this setup, the <code>value</code> of “no” (from the hidden <code>input</code>) will be submitted by default. If the checkbox is ticked, its <code>value</code> is submitted instead, setting REMEMBERME to “yes”.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-choice-checkboxes">Multiple Choice Checkboxes</h2>

<p>The other way we often see checkboxes used is to enable users to choose zero or more items from a collection of options. Consider <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-02">this example</a> from <a href="http://chadevicelab.org/book-time">the Chattanooga Open Device Lab’s reservation form</a>. It allows users to choose the devices they’d like to include in their test matrix:</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-02" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>In this excerpt from the reservation form on the Chattanooga Open Device Lab website, users can choose to include gaming system options.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The markup they employ is pretty well-organized and straightforward: it’s a list of checkbox options.</p>

<p><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/d281f889a11634b45280.js?file=chaodl-checkbox-list.html"></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;nintendo-ds-lite&quot;&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;
             name=&quot;reservation_requested_device[]&quot;
             id=&quot;nintendo-ds-lite&quot;
             value=&quot;Nintendo DS Lite (Upper Cabinet #13)&quot;
             data-checkbox-required=&quot;&quot;
             &gt;
      Nintendo DS Lite
    &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;nintendo-wii&quot;&gt;
      &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;
             name=&quot;reservation_requested_device[]&quot;
             id=&quot;nintendo-wii&quot;
             value=&quot;Nintendo Wii (TV Area)&quot;
             data-checkbox-required=&quot;&quot;
             &gt;
      Nintendo Wii
    &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;!-- list continues --&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>As this is an instance where a user could choose more than one option, the back end needs to be able to capture that information in what’s called an “array”. An array, if you’re unfamiliar, is a collection of values. You’ll notice that the <code>name</code> given to each of these checkbox <code>input</code> elements is the same: “reservation_requested_device[]”. The square brackets (“[]”) at the end of the <code>name</code> are the magic bit that allows the values of <em>each</em> chosen “reservation_requested_device” checkbox to be submitted as the value of “reservation_requested_device”.</p>

<h2 id="applicable-attributes">Applicable Attributes</h2>

<p>Checkbox controls only use a subset of the typical <code>input</code> attributes. In particular, you’ll need to include</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>name</code> - This is the variable name you want to hold the user’s response. As mentioned in <a href="#multiple-choice-checkboxes">the previous section</a>, appending “[]” to the variable name will allow the variable to hold all of the user’s choices as opposed to only the final one.</li>
  <li><code>value</code> - This is the value that should be captured if the user ticks the checkbox.</li>
  <li><code>id</code> - The unique identifier you’re using for the control in order to explicitly associate it with a <code>label</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few optional attributes you might consider including as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>checked</code> - Use this null attribute if you want the default state of the checkbox to be ticked. This attribute should be used with caution. <strong>Don’t</strong> use this attribute to automatically check confirmation boxes for things like mailing list opt-ins. <strong>Do</strong> use this attribute when you are displaying sensible default settings or displaying confirmations the user has already made (e.g. in the user’s profile or when re-displaying the form when it has a submission error).</li>
  <li><code>required</code> - Use this to indicate the checkbox must be ticked for the form to be valid. It’s important to note that this attribute is typically only useful in confirmation checkbox scenarios. If you need a user to choose at least one from a multiple choice checkbox collection, it’s useless unless you need them to pick a specific one. To require one (or more) of a multiple choice checkbox group, you currently need to use JavaScript, like <a href="https://github.com/easy-designs/easy-checkbox-required.js">the one the Chattanooga Open Device Lab uses</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checkbox-vs-other-controls">Checkbox vs. Other Controls</h2>

<p>Checkboxes excel at allowing users to indicate preference from a pre-defined set of options. But there are other form control types that allow for similar control over user responses. That can make it difficult to decide which element to use.</p>

<h3 id="dropdown-list-select">Dropdown List (<code>select</code>)</h3>

<p>The <code>select</code> element is another tried and true option for allowing users to indicate preference. A simple two-choice <code>select</code> could achieve the same goal as a confirmation checkbox, but it’s a little clunkier. In terms of user interface, <code>select</code> elements require more clicks of your users. They also obscure the complete list of choices from view because only one options is displayed at a time. Their appearance makes them more compact, but can make it difficult to get a complete picture of what choices are available when you can’t see them all.</p>

<p>You can enable multiple choice in a  <code>select</code> element by adding the <code>multiple</code> attribute to it, but depending on the number of <code>option</code> elements, it could also be a little unwieldy. Depending on the size of the <code>select</code> and the number of options, you could also create an inner scroll that could be awkward on certain touch-based devices.</p>

<p>The <code>select</code> element has its place, but should be used sparingly. I’ll go in-depth with <code>select</code> elements in a future post.</p>

<h3 id="choose-one-inputtyperadio">Choose One (<code>input[type=radio]</code>)</h3>

<p>For simple confirmation questions, it’s completely valid to use a radio form control in lieu of a single checkbox. In fact, in some cases, it may offer a more explicit choice for your users. Consider <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-03">this example</a> from <a href="https://order.subway.com">Subway’s online ordering tool</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-03" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>In this excerpt from Subway’s online ordering tool, they use a checkbox to confirm the user wants their sandwich toasted.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A checkbox labelled “Fresh Toasted”, isn’t terribly clear. A better approach would be to ask something like “Would you like your sandwich toasted?” with radio controls for “yes” and “no”. Alternately, if they absolutely wanted to keep it as a checkbox, they could use a better label: “Please toast my sandwich”.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-04" class="media-container"><img  src="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" srcset="https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=1920&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 1920w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=600&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 600w,https://images1-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png&amp;resize_w=320&amp;container=focus&amp;refresh=2592000 320w" sizes="100vw" alt=""><figcaption>An alternate approach to the Subway interface, using radio controls.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Radio controls have their place, but are not often a one-to-one replacement for checkboxes. I will discuss radio controls in greater depth in another post.</p>

<h2 id="check-em-out">Check ’Em Out</h2>

<p>Checkboxes are an invaluable tool in the form building tool chest. Understanding their purpose and capabilities is key to using them properly and ensuring your forms are usable to the broadest number of users.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Forms exist on pretty much every site on the web in one form or another. They are the primary mechanism by which we gather information from our users.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Of course, before anyone can fill out a form, they need to know what it’s asking for. Labeling is key.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>A few months back, I relayed <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/consider-how-your-forms-read/">a story from Facebook</a> about how important the wording of their questions was in getting accurate responses from their users. The words we choose are incredibly important—your interface is a conversation with your users. I highly recommend reading up on that (and <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/">listening to the Radiolab episode</a> that spurred me to write it), but I’m going to spend the remainder of this post talking about the utilitarian aspects of labels and how to use them properly in your forms.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-dots">Connecting the Dots</h2>

<p>When you look at a basic form field, you have two bits of information: the field and the label.</p>

<p>The thing is, the text “Your Name” is not associated in any way with the <code>input</code>. Sure, a sighted person would likely be able to tell that that text is associated with the field, but no computer can tell that. And if a computer can’t tell the text and <code>input</code> are associated, your form control is inaccessible to anyone who uses assistive technology like a screen reader. It’s also going to pose a problem in the near-future of “headless UIs” like those hinted at by Cortana, Siri, and the Echo.</p>

<p>Thankfully, establishing a relationship between the two is quite easy using the <code>label</code> element. The most common (and preferable) way to do this is to wrap the labeling text in a <code>label</code> element. Then you create an explicit association with the field using the <code>for</code> attribute, which is an <code>id</code> reference. In other words, the value of the <code>for</code> attribute needs to match the value of the <code>id</code> attribute on the field you want to associate with that <code>label</code>.</p>

<p>With that markup in place, the programmatic connection between the elements is made and the results speak for themselves: When you focus the field, the contents of the <code>label</code> are read out.</p>

<h2 id="an-alternate-approach">An Alternate Approach</h2>

<p>Since I specifically referred to this approach as <em>explicit</em> association, you probably assumed that there’s another kind of association. And you were right: <em>implicit</em> association. Implicit association is created by wrapping a form control and its associated label text in a <code>label</code> element. I like to use this approach with radio and checkbox controls:</p>

<p>The reason I like to use implicit association with checkbox and radio controls has to do with ensuring the greatest breadth of support when it comes to styling inputs. For instance, if I set <code>width: 80%</code> on all <code>input</code> elements using a simple <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors">type selector</a>, that width would be applied to <em>all</em> <code>input</code> elements, including radio and checkbox controls. In order to prevent radio and checkbox controls from getting rendered at that width, I would need to assign an override value of <code>width: auto</code> to them them specifically. I can do that using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors">attribute selectors</a>:</p>

<p>While completely valid, that approach leaves out any browsers that don’t support attribute selection (e.g. IE 6). That may not seem like a deal-breaker in your book, but on the off chance some poor soul happens to be stuck using an out-of-date browser (as many are on mobile), I like to show them a little love. And, thankfully, using the implicit markup pattern for checkboxes and radio controls allows for this quite easily: I just use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors">descendent selector</a> instead.</p>

<p>This approach results in a greater amount of support and, incidentally, less CSS.</p>

<h2 id="added-benefit-interactivity">Added Benefit: Interactivity</h2>

<p>Obviously, associated labels are great for folks who use screen readers, but they have another benefit: tapping on a <code>label</code> will focus or activate the associated form control.</p>

<p>This isn’t a game-changer when it comes to standard text fields, but it’s an exceptional affordance when it comes to radio and checkbox controls, especially on mobile, as it vastly increases the tappable region used to activate the control.</p>

<p>To create incredibly generous tap targets on mobile devices, we can take things a little further. Add padding to the top and bottom of the <code>label</code> to make it bigger and then use negative margins to counter that enlargement and keep the layout as it was before the padding was applied.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that older versions of Internet Explorer only provide the focus/interaction benefit when you use explicit label association. That’s why I like the combo approach of implicit <em>and</em> explicit association for checkbox and radio controls.</p>

<p><ins datetime="2015-12-09" cite="#comment-2374683375">As Dennis Lembrée mentions in the comments below, Dragon’s Naturally Speaking also doesn’t recognize implicit association, which is why it’s incredibly important to use explicit association even if it seems implicit association should suffice.</ins></p>

<h2 id="placeholders-arent-labels">Placeholders Aren’t Labels</h2>

<p>HTML5 ushered in a new option for working with <code>input</code> elements: the <code>placeholder</code> attribute. This declarative attribute makes it possible to offer hint as to the sort of content you were looking for in a field. In <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-placeholder">supporting browsers</a>, it appears in the field, ghosted back a bit, and disappears when you start typing a response.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<figure id="fig-2015-11-11-05" class="media-container"><img src="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-11-11/05.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>An animation showing a placeholder in action on <a href="http://webstandardssherpa.com"><cite>Web Standards Sherpa</cite></a>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Having this natively supported in the browser was a huge boon. For years we’d been using JavaScript to achieve this very effect—albeit typically for label text—in an effort to create more compact forms. Now we get the effect without having to include any additional files or libraries.</p>

<p>Of course, since <code>placeholder</code> implements an existing pattern, it came with baggage. People commonly achieved this effect by (ab)using the <code>value</code> attribute as a fake label. As such, its introduction didn’t do much to increase the accessibility of forms. <em>Form controls need a label</em>. If you want to make your form more compact, you can do that using proper markup and a little clever CSS.</p>

<p>Mary Lou assembled some beautiful examples of this approach in her <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/01/08/inspiration-text-input-effects/">Inspiration for Text Input Effects</a>. I highly recommend you check those out, but here’s a teaser to whet your whistle:</p>

<hr />

<p>We don’t have a ton of elements in HTML, which is why it’s important that we properly use the ones we do have. Hopefully this has provided a helpful overview of how to properly label form controls using HTML.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>When we’re not, you know, tracking them with a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/10/verizons-zombie-cookie-gets-new-life/">super cookie</a> or something. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Browsers typically exhibit two different behaviors here. Some hide the placeholder text as soon as you focus the field, others hide it only when you start typing. Either one works although, admittedly, I favor the text disappearing when you type rather than when the field receives focus. I can see how that approach might confuse some users, I just prefer it because it ensures you see the placeholder. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Wherein I dispel the myth that progressive enhancement has no place in news, healthcare, education, financial, commerce, and single-page app websites. Lots of goodies in here.</p>

<p>This version is an updated 40-minute distillation of the hour and a half talk <a href="http://jennlukas.com/">Jenn Lukas</a> and I gave at <a href="https://uxim15.uie.com/">UX Immersion Mobile</a> back in April. The video of that one is available from <a href="https://aycl.uie.com/">UIE’s All You Can Learn</a>. Jenn designed the slides and <a href="http://cargocollective.com/mattsutter">Matt Sutter</a> did the wonderful illustrations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While listening to <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/">Radiolab’s “The Trust Engineers”</a>, I’ll admit I got a little excited when they started talking about web form performance. And no, not “performance” in the time-to-download sense, but “performance” in terms of how well the forms performed in attempting to capture meaningful, actionable data.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’ll set the scene: It’s the holiday season in 2011 and people are uploading photos to Facebook like crazy. In the span of a few days, Facebook processed more photo uploads than are contained in the entirety of Flickr. Seriously, that’s a lot of photos.</p>

<p>Anyway, one unintended consequence of this deluge of photo uploads was a significant uptick in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/189722821075378">photo reports</a>. Facebook received millions of them, but they made no sense: Moms holding babies reported for harassment, pictures of puppies reported for hate speech, and so on. Roughly 97% of these photo reports were miscategorized.</p>

<p>When Facebook engineers reached out to some of the users who had reported these photos for a bit more background behind their decisions, they discovered that many of the reports were because users didn’t want the photo on Facebook reasons other than the options provided. In some cases it was because they didn’t like how they looked in the photo and in others it was because the photo was of an ex or even a beloved pet they shared with an ex.</p>

<p>The existing photo reporting form had not done a good job of accounting for these more personal reasons for wanting a photo removed, so the Facebook engineers went to work. They added a step that asked <em>How does this photo make you feel?</em> The options were simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embarrassing</li>
  <li>Upsetting</li>
  <li>Saddening</li>
  <li>Bad Photo</li>
  <li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>The “other” option also provided a free-response field to fill in.</p>

<p>With this system in place, they found that 50% of reporters would choose one of the provided options. That was pretty helpful, but there was still a problem: 34% of the “other” respondents were writing “It’s embarrassing” in the blank rather than choosing the “embarrassing” option already provided.</p>

<p>What they realized was that people were not identifying with the “embarrassing” text (or may have even thought it was referring to them, rather than assuming the implied “It’s”). A subtle shift in language was needed, so they changed the label to <em>Please describe the photo</em>. And they updated the options to mirror how people actually talk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s embarrassing</li>
  <li>It’s a bad photo of me</li>
  <li>It makes me sad</li>
</ul>

<p>With this subtle change, they were able to increase the percentage of photo reporters who chose one of the options provided to a whopping 78%.</p>

<p>Sometimes we feel compelled to create forms that are very clinical. In the survey world we’re often taught to limit the “personality” of our forms in order to avoid influencing the responses.</p>

<p>That said, we need to remember that we are authoring interfaces that will be used by actual people. When we are creating forms that don’t require that kind of scientific rigor, we can (and should) do whatever we can to make the interaction more human.</p>

<p>Ask real questions: <em>What’s your name?</em>, <em>What’s your email?</em>, and <em>How would you prefer we contact you?</em> are far more friendly than <em>Name</em>, <em>Email</em>, and <em>Contact Preference</em>.</p>

<p>A little thoughtful consideration for the people who need to fill in your form goes a long way toward making them feel at ease and also helps to ensure the feedback you receive is accurate, valuable, and actionable.</p>
