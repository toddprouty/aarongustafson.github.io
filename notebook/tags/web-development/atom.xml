    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>User experience encompasses more than just the interface. Download speed, render performance, and the cost of accessing a site are often overlooked areas when it comes to the practice of UX, but they all affect how users experience what we build on the Web.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’m always looking for ways to improve these aspects of my own site. And, since it’s my own personal playground, I often use it as a test-bed for new technologies, ideas, and techniques. My latest adventure was inspired by a bunch of <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/">articles and posts I’ve linked to recently</a>, especially</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9775">Jeremy Keith’s “My First Service Worker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/serviceworker-for-offline/">Nicolas Bevacqua’s “Making a Simple Site Work Offline with ServiceWorker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/service-workers--dynamic-responsive-images-using-webp-images/10132/">Dean Hume’s “Service Workers: Dynamic Responsive Images Using Webp Images”</a>, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@cramforce/not-so-micro-optimizations-f867c47b832d#.satdv0fap">Malte Ubl’s “Not so micro optimizations”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After reading these pieces, I decided to see how much I could do to improve the performance of this site, especially on posts with a lot of images and embedded code samples, like <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/labeled-with-love/">my recent post on form labels</a>.</p>

<h2 id="using-resource-hints">Using Resource Hints</h2>

<p>To kick things off, I followed Malte’s advice and used <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/">Resource Hints</a> to <em>prime the pump</em> for any third-party servers hosting assets I use frequently (e.g. Disqus, Twitter, etc.). I used the code Malte references in <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">the AMP Project</a> as my starting point and <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/main/resource-hints.js">added two new methods (<code>preconnect()</code> and <code>prefetch()</code>) to my global <code>AG</code> object</a>. With that library code in place, I can call those methods as necessary from within my other JavaScript files. Here’s a simplified extract from <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/post/disqus.js">my Disqus integration script</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea resource-hints-sample.js embed %}</p>

<p>While a minor addition, the speed improvement in <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=resource%20hints">supporting browsers</a> was noticeable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="integrating-service-worker">Integrating Service Worker</h2>

<p>With that in the bag, I set about making my first <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">Service Worker</a>. I started off gently, using Dean’s piece as a guide. I added a WebP conversion bit to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/tasks/gulp/images.js">my image processing Gulp task</a> to get the files in place and then I created the Service Worker. By default, <a href="https://gist.github.com/deanhume/c04478df744ce833925c#file-client-hints-service-worker-js">Dean’s code</a> converts <em>all</em> JPG and PNG requests to WebP responses, so I set it up to limit the requests to only those files being requested directly from my server. I have no way of knowing if WebP equivalents of every JPG and PNG exist on the open web (probably not), but I know they exist on my server. Here’s the updated code:</p>

<p>{% gist ff6aef09a10038e1728a webp-service-worker.js embed %}</p>

<p>When I began tucking to the caching possibilities of Service Workers, following Nicolas’ and Jeremy’s posts, I <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker/fetch-cached.js">opted to tweak Nicholas’ caching setup a bit</a>. I’m still not completely thrilled with it, but it’s a work in progress. I’m sure I will tweak as I get more familiar with the technology.</p>

<p>To keep my Service Worker code modularized (like my other JavaScript code), I opted to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/tree/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker">break it up into separate files</a> and am using Gulp to merge them all together and move the combined file into the root of the site. If you’d like to follow a similar path, feel free to adapt this Gulp task (which builds all of my JavaScript):</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea gulp-scripts.js embed %}</p>

<p>As most of the walkthroughs recommended that you version your Service Worker if you’re doing any caching, I set mine up to be auto-versioned by inserting a timestamp (lines 23-27, above) into my Service Worker header file (line 3, below):</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea _header.js embed %}</p>

<p>Service Workers are still pretty new (and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">modestly supported</a>), but it’s definitely interesting to see what’s possible using them. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9844">Like Jeremy</a>, I want to do a bit more exploration into caching and how it may actually <em>increase</em> the monetary cost of accessing a website if not used properly. Like any powerful tool, we need to wield it wisely.</p>

<figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/dlmcYrvalMmAw/giphy.gif" alt="Animated GIF of a guy accidentally launching a board into his helper while power sanding." /></figure>

<h2 id="making-gists-static">Making Gists Static</h2>

<p>On particularly code-heavy posts (yes, like this one), I make liberal use of Gists. They’re quite useful, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/BinaryMuse/803483">the Gist plugin for Jekyll</a>, while good, still requests a script from Github in order to load the pretty printed version of the Gist. On some posts, that can mean 5 or more additional network requests, not to mention execution time for the JavaScript. It’s yet another dependency that could prohibit you from quickly getting to the content you’re looking for. Additionally, <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">if JavaScript should be available, but isn’t</a>, you get nothing (since the <code>noscript</code> content is only evaluated if JavaScript support isn’t available or if a user turns it off).</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, I decided to revise the plugin and make it capable of downloading the JavaScript code directly. It then extracts the HTML markup that the JavaScript would be writing into the page and just embeds it directly. It also caches the result, which is handy for speeding up the build process.</p>

<p>You can grab <a href="https://gist.github.com/aarongustafson/b98add8f3580f6707cf5">my fork of the Gist Jekyll Plugin as, well, a Gist</a>. It’s also <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/plugins/gist_tag.rb">in the source of this site on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hopefully-a-little-faster">(Hopefully) A Little Faster</h2>

<p>All told, these changes have gotten the render time of this site down significantly across the board.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Even more so on browsers that support Service Workers and Resource Hints. I’ll likely continue tweaking as I go, but I wanted to share my process, code, and thoughts in case any of it might be useful to you in your own work. In the end, it’s all about creating better experiences for our users. How our sites perform is a big part of that.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Sadly I forgot to run some speed tests prior to rolling out this change and I didn’t feel like rolling back the site, so I don’t have solid numbers for you. That said, it seemed to shave nearly 2 seconds off of the load time on heavy pages like the post I mentioned. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Again, I don’t have the numbers, but I am routinely seeing <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> reached between 400-600ms with Service Worker caching in play. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/we-need-more-empathy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a while now I’ve been <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/designing-with-empathy-breaking-development-nashville-2013">beating the “empathy” drum</a> (<a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1810">notes</a>), trying to get folks in our industry to understand the importance of creating connections with the people for whom we build software, websites, etc. After all, we design and build tools to solve the needs of actual people, not some generic “user”.<!-- more --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s tough to connect with other people and we often fall into the trap of designing products for us and people like us. Jeffrey Zeldman characterizes the problem perfectly in <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/12/28/unexamined-privilege-is-the-real-source-of-cruelty-in-facebooks-your-year-in-review/">his recent post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we keep throwing only young, mostly white, mostly upper middle class people at the engine that makes our digital world go, we’ll keep getting camera and reminder and hookup apps—things that make an already privileged life even smoother—and we’ll keep producing features that sound like a good idea to everyone in the room, until they unexpectedly stab someone in the heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Empathy is difficult when we are surrounded by others like us. We need to be surrounded by different people. Certainly gender and ethnic diversity is incredibly important here, but so is diversity of experience. As Jeffrey astutely points out, diversity in the room where Facebook’s “Year in Review” concept was given the green light would have—I have to hope—helped create some safeguards to keep some of their actual customers from being reminded of tragedies they experienced this year.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, the worst thing they probably discussed was an embarrassing hookup being celebrated, but I’ve had several friends lose children and loved ones this year, other friends battling serious illnesses, and still others who have suffered losses of different sorts. All bore their souls on Facebook in the past year and this feature has brought it back and, in some cases, <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/">celebrated these tragic events in a very uncanny and dispassionate way</a>.</p>

<p>And Facebook isn’t the only company to blame for this sort of thing. Pretty much every social network suffers from similar issues. Reading the comments on the various press accounts of this story have revealed similar problems at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/facebook-apologizes-for-morbid-results-with-its-year-in-review-nag/?comments=1&amp;post=28196195#comment-28196195">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/facebook-apologizes-for-morbid-results-with-its-year-in-review-nag/?comments=1&amp;post=28196709#comment-28196709">Google+</a>, <a href="http://www.deathanddigitallegacy.com/2010/08/05/twitter-recommends-dead-friends/">Twitter</a>, and others. We can and need to do better.</p>

<p>In order to address these issues, we need to flex our empathetic muscles. We need to create connections with people who are not like us. People who live in different neighborhoods. People who come from different countries. People who require alternate means to accessing our sites and services. We need to see that the world is full of differences.</p>

<p>Life is full of great joy as well as great tragedy. When we acknowledge diversity of experience and actually embrace it, we become better designers.</p>

      <p>I don’t mind the aggregate “users”, but “user” is too clinical and distanced for my tastes. Terms like “the user” keep us from connecting with the people who actually use our software and when we are disconnected from our users, we will not do a great job of solving their problems. And solving problems is the whole point of design. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/autoplay-dont-do-it/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-21T15:12:50-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/autoplay-dont-do-it</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/09/04/facebooks-autoplay-has-led-to-a-60-boost-in-traffic-on-mobile-networks/">GogOm reported on how Facebook’s decision to autoplay videos led to a 60% increase in mobile data usage</a>. It was a business decision with the intent of increasing engagement, but it was a bad decision from a user experience. It’s a tax on users and they weren’t to happy about it.</p>

<p>You may be wondering <em>Why is this a bad thing for users? They want to see videos, so we’re just giving them what they want.</em> Well, let me share a little story.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I was in Lisbon for <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/uxlx/">UxLx</a> last year and was on roaming data through my mobile provider. At the hotel, the Wifi was giving me trouble, so I opted to tether my computer so I can pull down a document I needed. Chrome crashed. Lame, but no big deal. I relaunched it and, Chrome being the helpful browser that it is, all of my tabs were restored and I got back to work.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I got a text message from my provider: I’d just used a tremendous amount of my data in a very short amount of time. And I had only landed an hour before. I was understandably concerned. And perplexed. What happened?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out one of the tabs that re-spawned after Chrome crashed was a page on YouTube. And on that page was an hour-long video. In HD. And it auto-played. I had the volume off and it was in background tab, so I had no idea.</p>

<p>YouTube’s “business decision” to autoplay their videos cost me real money. A lot of it.</p>

<p>Don’t autoplay. Any benefits you might see in user engagement are probably going to be drowned out by legitimate complaints from your users. Just don’t do it.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/633446180035470">disable auto-play in Facebook</a>, but first of all you have to know it’s an option. Facebook gives you the choice of turning it on or off entirely or to turn it on only over Wifi. That may seem like a great compromise, but I’d like to put forward a few arguments as to why it’s not:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Tethering:</em> If I am tethered to my phone, it is likely being done over Wifi. Even if my browser is aware that I am on Wifi and even if the website is paying attention to that (using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/">Network Informaion API</a>), the website is probably going to get a false positive for Wifi even though the <em>actual</em> data connection is over a mobile network.</li>
  <li><em>Metered Wifi:</em> Hotels and other providers often limit how much data you can use. You could be on an awesomely fast Wifi network, but if you are limited to 100MB—it happens—being on Wifi doesn’t matter.</li>
</ol>

<p>So again: Autoplay, don’t do it.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/css-variables-are-a-bad-idea/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-04T14:58:01-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/css-variables-are-a-bad-idea</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll level with you: I used to think I wanted variables in CSS.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I love the idea of being able to abstract reusable bits like colors, border widths, font sizes, and the like to obviously named variables. It’s a far more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> approach and makes maintenance far easier.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Before I made the leap to using a CSS preprocessor, I was convinced we needed CSS variables, but I always wondered how we might make it possible without breaking one of the fundamental <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html#design-principles">design principles of CSS</a>: Forward and backward compatibility. Take a look at this example (which is based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/">the working draft spec</a>) and I think you’ll spot the problem:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 css-vairables.css embed %}</p>

<p>For a browser that understands CSS variables, the interpreted stylesheet would look like this:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 desired-result.css embed %}</p>

<p>But any browser that doesn’t understand the variables would never get the color values because browsers follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#parsing-errors">the rules of fault tolerance in CSS</a> and ignore anything they don’t understand. The introduction of variables to CSS would effectively build a wall between older browsers and new ones. (For the record, as of this writing, <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables">only Firefox has implemented CSS variables</a>).</p>

<p>In order to serve the broadest spectrum of devices, we’d have to provide a fallback like this:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 css-variables-fallback.css embed %}</p>

<p>But that kinda defeats the whole purpose, right?</p>

<p>Preprocessors already give us this access to variables today (along with nesting, mixins, and programmatic structures like conditionals, loops, etc.). Here’s a SASS example:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 sass-variables.scss embed %}</p>

<p>The big difference here is that this document is a source file, it is not what is sent to the browser. This file is compiled by the preprocessor into actual CSS, which is what we send to the browser and is exactly what we wanted in the first place:</p>

<p>{% gist c3ddcb792eb69e0703e1 desired-result.css embed %}</p>

<p>And it works on every browser that supports CSS, all the way back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Difficulty_with_adoption">IE 3</a>.</p>

<p>With a preprocessor like SASS, Less, or Stylus, I get all of the maintainability benefits without sacrificing browser support. It’s a no-brainer. But even if that were not true, there’s another issue to consider: If I push CSS variables to browsers, they have to parse the CSS and substitute the variables before they can apply the styles.</p>

<p>Now I’m sure browser makers can find ways to optimize this process, but it’s bound to affect the rendering time. And not in a positive way. I don’t even want to think about how bad it would be on a mobile chipset, especially on a low-end device.</p>

<p>Honestly, I love using variables… in the source files I use with a preprocessor. Given the potential loss of browser support, the pointless fallbacks I’d have to use if I wanted to continue supporting older browsers, the existence of numerous preprocessor options that solve the abstraction problem in a backward- and forward-compatible way, and the fact that CSS variables would make browsers have to work even harder to achieve the desired result, I’m not convinced we need them.</p>

<p>CSS variables are a bad idea.</p>
