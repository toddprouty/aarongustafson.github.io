    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2014, I had the great pleasure of listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/misprintedtype">Ola Gasidlo</a> of <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hood.ie</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/103221949">discuss the importance of offline</a> at Beyond Tellerrand in Düsseldorf, Germany. Her excellent talk was my introduction to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=offline+first">the “Offline First” movement</a> and, while I can get behind the idea, I’ve had some serious issues with the name. And with the rise of Service Workers as a simple, usable means of making our content available offline, I thought it worth revisiting the idea of “offline first”, if only to address its core fallacy.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First, the good stuff: The “offline first” movement clearly recognizes the current dilemma of our time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We live in a disconnected &amp; battery powered world, but our technology and best practices are a leftover from the always connected &amp; steadily powered past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/offline.html">App Cache</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/">Web SQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/">Web Storage</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">Indexed DB</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">Service Workers</a>, and a handful of other specs and ideas were all created to address this core limitation of the Web. They also make it possible to compete with “native” software experiences. I am 100% on board with this move. It sucks to open Chrome on my mobile and switch to a tab that’s been tucked out of view for a while only to have the page fail to load because I happen to be traveling abroad without a data plan. If that site was made to work offline, the fact that Chrome had recycled the RAM and CPU that tab had been consuming would be less of a problem and the page would load instantly from the cache.</p>

<p>Tunnels… hotel wifi… high latency mobile networks… expensive roaming data plans… these are all reasons we need an offline Web. I’m incredibly thankful for all of the hard work the smart folks working on solutions like these are contributing.</p>

<p>Also inline with the “offline first” movement, I think it’s important to consider the offline experience early in a project, so it isn’t forgotten or haphazardly bolted on. We need to make deliberate choices about what content and assets we are caching. We need to plan for offline, maybe not <em>first</em>, but certainly early.</p>

<p>All of this is to say I don’t have an issue with the philosophy of “offline first”, but I do take issue with the name. As a term, it’s a bit disingenuous. Looking at other “firsts”—”mobile first” or (to go back little further) “content first”—these terms work on multiple levels: They remind us to keep the core purpose of a page or interface central to our planning. They also support an experience that begins and ends with that core.</p>

<p>A “mobile first” experience starts with a distraction-free central message or content, optimized for a small screen and (often) a single, narrow viewport. It can be enhanced for larger screens and more capable devices, but that core experience may be all some users get, and that’s ok. Users will have an experience (and a site that works) no matter what. The same is true with a “content first” approach; its experience remains available regardless of device or access mechanism. Sure, both “mobile first” and “content first” require the network, but guess what: “<strong>Offline first” requires network connectivity too!</strong> <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/forums/showthread.php?62807-Run-Website-from-a-Flashdrive-or-CD">You don’t see many websites delivering their content on USB drives</a>, so all of the code required to make the offline experience possible in the first place requires an initial (and stable) connection to the Web. In other words, offline can’t be first.</p>

<p>You may be wondering <em>Why is that important?</em> It’s important because, historically, a “first” approach (as I mentioned) sets an expectation of that experience always being available. Offline can’t provide that.</p>

<p>Moreover, offline has another core dependency beyond the network: JavaScript. Without JavaScript, none of your fancy offline stuff—except App Cache, which few folks are using these days—will work. And yes, I know, <em>everyone</em> has JavaScript support… but the reality is that <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">not everyone will get your JavaScript enhancements</a>, <a href="http://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html">even if that were actually the case</a>.</p>

<p>Please don’t misunderstand the purpose of this post: I applaud the ideas behind the “offline first” movement and the amazing work that community is doing. And you should absolutely incorporate offline into projects you are building for the Web. Users with capable devices and browsers will thank you for it. Just try not to use the term “offline first” or at least be prepared for me to cringe a little when you do. Maybe I’m the only one who feels this way; if so, I’m okay with that. But, then again, semantics matter. Maybe we need a different rallying cry. Sadly “Offline Too” doesn’t have the same ring to it.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-event-apart-nashville-2016-day-one/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-16T10:54:59-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-event-apart-nashville-2016-day-one</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to spend Tuesday in Nashville for An Event Apart (for reasons that will be revealed in about a month), but I did catch Monday and it was amazing.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The esteemed <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> kicked the day off with a talk entitled <em>Designing with Web Standards in 2016</em>. A theme he touched on repeatedly was that none of the problems we are facing in web design today are new problems. It’s a topic near and dear to my heart, something I wrote about in the closing chapter of <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/"><cite>Adaptive Web Design’s</cite> Second Edition</a> and <a href="/notebook/learn-from-the-past-enhance-for-the-future/">recently spoke about at EnhanceConf in London</a>. He knocked this one out of the park and my head was nodding so much my neck began to hurt.</p>

<p>Next up was <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/">my former WaSP colleague</a> <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew</a> to give us the skinny on CSS Grid Layouts. This is an amazing spec that I’ve always struggled to understand fully (despite the fact that’s i’ve written a Javascript polyfill for it). Rachel made it crystal clear and got me very excited about the future of layout on the Web.</p>

<p><a href="http://jensimmons.com/">Jen Simmons</a> dropped some serious CSS-related design knowledge bombs that perfectly complimented Rachel’s talk. She discussed Flexbox, CSS Shapes, Multi-column layout, viewport units and more, demonstrating how they can be used right now to progressively enhance the design of your sites.</p>

<p>After lunch, <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> took to the stage to talk about Style Guides. I only caught the last half—I’ll admit to doing some last-minute rehearsing in the hallway—but the bits I did catch were good. I’ve seen his Atomic Design talk a few times, which this one builds on. In this talk he touches on a lot of the atomic design concepts, but he also talked a lot more about workflow and the role of the front-end developer. No doubt the evolution of this talk has come in large part through writing <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">a book on Atomic Design</a> and in hosting <a href="http://styleguides.io/podcast/">a podcast with Anna Debenham on website style guides</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I was given the opportunity to share some thoughts and advice on designing and building. My talk, <em>The Features of Highly Effective Forms</em>, evolved out of several earlier talks on building forms. With this one, I wanted to strike a little more balance between the nuts and bolts of building forms and the hows and whys of building better forms.</p>

<p>The deck, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/the-features-of-highly-effective-forms-an-event-apart-nashville-2016">which I’ve posted to SlideShare</a>, doesn’t stand on its own quite as well as some of my other forms decks simply because the talk contained a lot of storytelling I chose not to pair with slides—instead opting for an black screen so folks could focus—but I did call out the salient points. I’ve begun writing up some of the recommendations as part of my <a href="/notebook/tags/web-forms/">Modern Web Forms Best Practices series</a> and will continue to do so in the future. And one of the stories I told, which I highly recommend you check out, had to do with <a href="/notebook/consider-how-your-forms-read/">a lesson Facebook learned in managing how users report offensive photos</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a> wrapped the day up with a discussion of the future of interface as things move from digital back to physical. He talked about a lot of really cool new tech that has me excited about the future, including <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">the Physical Web</a>, which Josh had running as a live demo. I wonder if anyone noticed I had a beacon running too ;-)</p>

<p>All in all, day one was a blast. As always, Jeffrey, Eric, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/toby-malina-6247a028">Toby</a>, and <a href="http://www.escapadeproductions.com/">Marci</a> do an awesome job programming their events. I’m really bummed I could not stick around to see <a href="http://valhead.com/">Val</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/grigs">Jason</a>, <a href="http://www.kryshiggins.com/">Krystal</a>, <a href="http://meyerweb.com/">Eric</a>, <a href="http://braintraffic.com/">Kristina</a>, and <a href="http://cameronmoll.com/">Cameron</a> rock it out though. I’m sure it was amazing.</p>

<p>You can check out attendees thoughts from the event by <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23aeansh&amp;src=typd">searching Twitter using the #aeansh hashtag</a>. I’ve <a href="https://storify.com/AaronGustafson/reactions-and-takeaways-from-my-aeansh-talk">collected reactions to my talk on Storify</a> for posterity as well.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/affirming-user-choice-with-checkboxes/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-06T14:24:31-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/affirming-user-choice-with-checkboxes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Checkbox” form controls have long been a part of software. They enable users to provide a simple binary response—yes or no. On the Web, we often see them in two scenarios: confirmations and multiple choice.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="confirmation-checkboxes">Confirmation Checkboxes</h2>

<p>Standalone checkboxes are often employed to enable users to affirm a statement, as in <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-01">this example</a> from <a href="https://online.americanexpress.com/myca/logon/us/action/LogonHandler?request_type=LogonHandler&amp;Face=en_US#lilo_loginForm">the American Express login form</a> where a customer can indicate they’d like the site to remember them.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-01" class="media-container">{% adaptive_image /i/posts/2016-01-06/01.png %}<figcaption>American Express’ login form offers users the option of being remembered. As that is a binary choice (e.g. yes or no), the checkbox makes sense.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Here’s a simplification of the markup they’re using:</p>

<p>{% gist d281f889a11634b45280 american-express-login-simplified.html %}</p>

<p>This works really well, though I generally prefer to <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/labeled-with-love/#an-alternate-approach">combine explicit and implicit labeling</a> to simplify my CSS selectors and broaden their applicability. Here’s how I would rewrite this control:</p>

<p>{% gist d281f889a11634b45280 american-express-login-reimagined.html %}</p>

<p>Regardless of the markup pattern itself, it’s important to note the explicit association of the form control and the <code>label</code> element (using the <code>for</code> attribute). You’ll also notice the input has a straightforward <code>name</code> value which will be submitted to the back end if the user ticks the box.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that some back-end systems may require a value be submitted for the given variable name (in this case, “REMEMBERME”) regardless of whether the user has ticked the checkbox. If that’s a requirement, you can alter the pattern to use a hidden <code>input</code> as well:</p>

<p>{% gist d281f889a11634b45280 american-express-login-with-hidden.html %}</p>

<p>The source order matters because with matching <code>name</code> values, the final submittable <code>value</code> will always be the one the back-end receives. With this setup, the <code>value</code> of “no” (from the hidden <code>input</code>) will be submitted by default. If the checkbox is ticked, its <code>value</code> is submitted instead, setting REMEMBERME to “yes”.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-choice-checkboxes">Multiple Choice Checkboxes</h2>

<p>The other way we often see checkboxes used is to enable users to choose zero or more items from a collection of options. Consider <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-02">this example</a> from <a href="http://chadevicelab.org/book-time">the Chattanooga Open Device Lab’s reservation form</a>. It allows users to choose the devices they’d like to include in their test matrix:</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-02" class="media-container">{% adaptive_image /i/posts/2016-01-06/02.png %}<figcaption>In this excerpt from the reservation form on the Chattanooga Open Device Lab website, users can choose to include gaming system options.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The markup they employ is pretty well-organized and straightforward: it’s a list of checkbox options.</p>

<p>{% gist d281f889a11634b45280 chaodl-checkbox-list.html %}</p>

<p>As this is an instance where a user could choose more than one option, the back end needs to be able to capture that information in what’s called an “array”. An array, if you’re unfamiliar, is a collection of values. You’ll notice that the <code>name</code> given to each of these checkbox <code>input</code> elements is the same: “reservation_requested_device[]”. The square brackets (“[]”) at the end of the <code>name</code> are the magic bit that allows the values of <em>each</em> chosen “reservation_requested_device” checkbox to be submitted as the value of “reservation_requested_device”.</p>

<h2 id="applicable-attributes">Applicable Attributes</h2>

<p>Checkbox controls only use a subset of the typical <code>input</code> attributes. In particular, you’ll need to include</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>name</code> - This is the variable name you want to hold the user’s response. As mentioned in <a href="#multiple-choice-checkboxes">the previous section</a>, appending “[]” to the variable name will allow the variable to hold all of the user’s choices as opposed to only the final one.</li>
  <li><code>value</code> - This is the value that should be captured if the user ticks the checkbox.</li>
  <li><code>id</code> - The unique identifier you’re using for the control in order to explicitly associate it with a <code>label</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few optional attributes you might consider including as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>checked</code> - Use this null attribute if you want the default state of the checkbox to be ticked. This attribute should be used with caution. <strong>Don’t</strong> use this attribute to automatically check confirmation boxes for things like mailing list opt-ins. <strong>Do</strong> use this attribute when you are displaying sensible default settings or displaying confirmations the user has already made (e.g. in the user’s profile or when re-displaying the form when it has a submission error).</li>
  <li><code>required</code> - Use this to indicate the checkbox must be ticked for the form to be valid. It’s important to note that this attribute is typically only useful in confirmation checkbox scenarios. If you need a user to choose at least one from a multiple choice checkbox collection, it’s useless unless you need them to pick a specific one. To require one (or more) of a multiple choice checkbox group, you currently need to use JavaScript, like <a href="https://github.com/easy-designs/easy-checkbox-required.js">the one the Chattanooga Open Device Lab uses</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checkbox-vs-other-controls">Checkbox vs. Other Controls</h2>

<p>Checkboxes excel at allowing users to indicate preference from a pre-defined set of options. But there are other form control types that allow for similar control over user responses. That can make it difficult to decide which element to use.</p>

<h3 id="dropdown-list-select">Dropdown List (<code>select</code>)</h3>

<p>The <code>select</code> element is another tried and true option for allowing users to indicate preference. A simple two-choice <code>select</code> could achieve the same goal as a confirmation checkbox, but it’s a little clunkier. In terms of user interface, <code>select</code> elements require more clicks of your users. They also obscure the complete list of choices from view because only one options is displayed at a time. Their appearance makes them more compact, but can make it difficult to get a complete picture of what choices are available when you can’t see them all.</p>

<p>You can enable multiple choice in a  <code>select</code> element by adding the <code>multiple</code> attribute to it, but depending on the number of <code>option</code> elements, it could also be a little unwieldy. Depending on the size of the <code>select</code> and the number of options, you could also create an inner scroll that could be awkward on certain touch-based devices.</p>

<p>The <code>select</code> element has its place, but should be used sparingly. I’ll go in-depth with <code>select</code> elements in a future post.</p>

<h3 id="choose-one-inputtyperadio">Choose One (<code>input[type=radio]</code>)</h3>

<p>For simple confirmation questions, it’s completely valid to use a radio form control in lieu of a single checkbox. In fact, in some cases, it may offer a more explicit choice for your users. Consider <a href="#fig-2016-01-06-03">this example</a> from <a href="https://order.subway.com">Subway’s online ordering tool</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-03" class="media-container">{% adaptive_image /i/posts/2016-01-06/03.png %}<figcaption>In this excerpt from Subway’s online ordering tool, they use a checkbox to confirm the user wants their sandwich toasted.</figcaption></figure>

<p>A checkbox labelled “Fresh Toasted”, isn’t terribly clear. A better approach would be to ask something like “Would you like your sandwich toasted?” with radio controls for “yes” and “no”. Alternately, if they absolutely wanted to keep it as a checkbox, they could use a better label: “Please toast my sandwich”.</p>

<figure id="fig-2016-01-06-04" class="media-container">{% adaptive_image /i/posts/2016-01-06/04.png %}<figcaption>An alternate approach to the Subway interface, using radio controls.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Radio controls have their place, but are not often a one-to-one replacement for checkboxes. I will discuss radio controls in greater depth in another post.</p>

<h2 id="check-em-out">Check ’Em Out</h2>

<p>Checkboxes are an invaluable tool in the form building tool chest. Understanding their purpose and capabilities is key to using them properly and ensuring your forms are usable to the broadest number of users.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/speeding-things-up-with-service-worker-resource-hints-and-more/"/>
    <updated>2015-11-20T16:39:09-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/speeding-things-up-with-service-worker-resource-hints-and-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>User experience encompasses more than just the interface. Download speed, render performance, and the cost of accessing a site are often overlooked areas when it comes to the practice of UX, but they all affect how users experience what we build on the Web.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I’m always looking for ways to improve these aspects of my own site. And, since it’s my own personal playground, I often use it as a test-bed for new technologies, ideas, and techniques. My latest adventure was inspired by a bunch of <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/links/">articles and posts I’ve linked to recently</a>, especially</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9775">Jeremy Keith’s “My First Service Worker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/serviceworker-for-offline/">Nicolas Bevacqua’s “Making a Simple Site Work Offline with ServiceWorker”</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/service-workers--dynamic-responsive-images-using-webp-images/10132/">Dean Hume’s “Service Workers: Dynamic Responsive Images Using Webp Images”</a>, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@cramforce/not-so-micro-optimizations-f867c47b832d#.satdv0fap">Malte Ubl’s “Not so micro optimizations”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After reading these pieces, I decided to see how much I could do to improve the performance of this site, especially on posts with a lot of images and embedded code samples, like <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/labeled-with-love/">my recent post on form labels</a>.</p>

<h2 id="using-resource-hints">Using Resource Hints</h2>

<p>To kick things off, I followed Malte’s advice and used <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/">Resource Hints</a> to <em>prime the pump</em> for any third-party servers hosting assets I use frequently (e.g. Disqus, Twitter, etc.). I used the code Malte references in <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">the AMP Project</a> as my starting point and <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/main/resource-hints.js">added two new methods (<code>preconnect()</code> and <code>prefetch()</code>) to my global <code>AG</code> object</a>. With that library code in place, I can call those methods as necessary from within my other JavaScript files. Here’s a simplified extract from <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/post/disqus.js">my Disqus integration script</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea resource-hints-sample.js embed %}</p>

<p>While a minor addition, the speed improvement in <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=resource%20hints">supporting browsers</a> was noticeable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="integrating-service-worker">Integrating Service Worker</h2>

<p>With that in the bag, I set about making my first <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/service-workers/">Service Worker</a>. I started off gently, using Dean’s piece as a guide. I added a WebP conversion bit to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/tasks/gulp/images.js">my image processing Gulp task</a> to get the files in place and then I created the Service Worker. By default, <a href="https://gist.github.com/deanhume/c04478df744ce833925c#file-client-hints-service-worker-js">Dean’s code</a> converts <em>all</em> JPG and PNG requests to WebP responses, so I set it up to limit the requests to only those files being requested directly from my server. I have no way of knowing if WebP equivalents of every JPG and PNG exist on the open web (probably not), but I know they exist on my server. Here’s the updated code:</p>

<p>{% gist ff6aef09a10038e1728a webp-service-worker.js embed %}</p>

<p>When I began tucking to the caching possibilities of Service Workers, following Nicolas’ and Jeremy’s posts, I <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker/fetch-cached.js">opted to tweak Nicholas’ caching setup a bit</a>. I’m still not completely thrilled with it, but it’s a work in progress. I’m sure I will tweak as I get more familiar with the technology.</p>

<p>To keep my Service Worker code modularized (like my other JavaScript code), I opted to <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/tree/source/source/_javascript/serviceworker">break it up into separate files</a> and am using Gulp to merge them all together and move the combined file into the root of the site. If you’d like to follow a similar path, feel free to adapt this Gulp task (which builds all of my JavaScript):</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea gulp-scripts.js embed %}</p>

<p>As most of the walkthroughs recommended that you version your Service Worker if you’re doing any caching, I set mine up to be auto-versioned by inserting a timestamp (lines 23-27, above) into my Service Worker header file (line 3, below):</p>

<p>{% gist 7f05709cca9293e4efea _header.js embed %}</p>

<p>Service Workers are still pretty new (and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">modestly supported</a>), but it’s definitely interesting to see what’s possible using them. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9844">Like Jeremy</a>, I want to do a bit more exploration into caching and how it may actually <em>increase</em> the monetary cost of accessing a website if not used properly. Like any powerful tool, we need to wield it wisely.</p>

<figure><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/dlmcYrvalMmAw/giphy.gif" alt="Animated GIF of a guy accidentally launching a board into his helper while power sanding." /></figure>

<h2 id="making-gists-static">Making Gists Static</h2>

<p>On particularly code-heavy posts (yes, like this one), I make liberal use of Gists. They’re quite useful, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/BinaryMuse/803483">the Gist plugin for Jekyll</a>, while good, still requests a script from Github in order to load the pretty printed version of the Gist. On some posts, that can mean 5 or more additional network requests, not to mention execution time for the JavaScript. It’s yet another dependency that could prohibit you from quickly getting to the content you’re looking for. Additionally, <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/">if JavaScript should be available, but isn’t</a>, you get nothing (since the <code>noscript</code> content is only evaluated if JavaScript support isn’t available or if a user turns it off).</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, I decided to revise the plugin and make it capable of downloading the JavaScript code directly. It then extracts the HTML markup that the JavaScript would be writing into the page and just embeds it directly. It also caches the result, which is handy for speeding up the build process.</p>

<p>All told, these changes have gotten the render time of this site down significantly across the board.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Even more so on browsers that support Service Workers and Resource Hints. I’ll likely continue tweaking as I go, but I wanted to share my process, code, and thoughts in case any of it might be useful to you in your own work. In the end, it’s all about creating better experiences for our users. How our sites perform is a big part of that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Forms exist on pretty much every site on the web in one form or another. They are the primary mechanism by which we gather information from our users.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Of course, before anyone can fill out a form, they need to know what it’s asking for. Labeling is key.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>A few months back, I relayed <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/consider-how-your-forms-read/">a story from Facebook</a> about how important the wording of their questions was in getting accurate responses from their users. The words we choose are incredibly important—your interface is a conversation with your users. I highly recommend reading up on that (and <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/">listening to the Radiolab episode</a> that spurred me to write it), but I’m going to spend the remainder of this post talking about the utilitarian aspects of labels and how to use them properly in your forms.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-the-dots">Connecting the Dots</h2>

<p>When you look at a basic form field, you have two bits of information: the field and the label.</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-11-11-01" class="media-container">{% adaptive_image /i/posts/2015-11-11/01.png %}<figcaption>A typical form control: a label and a field.</figcaption></figure>

<p>You could achieve this with a minimum of markup:</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 unlabeled-field.html embed %}</p>

<p>The thing is, the text “Your Name” is not associated in any way with the <code>input</code>. Sure, a sighted person would likely be able to tell that that text is associated with the field, but no computer can tell that. And if a computer can’t tell the text and <code>input</code> are associated, your form control is inaccessible to anyone who uses assistive technology like a screen reader. It’s also going to pose a problem in the near-future of “headless UIs” like those hinted at by Cortana, Siri, and the Echo.</p>

<p>Thankfully, establishing a relationship between the two is quite easy using the <code>label</code> element. The most common (and preferable) way to do this is to wrap the labeling text in a <code>label</code> element. Then you create an explicit association with the field using the <code>for</code> attribute, which is an <code>id</code> reference. In other words, the value of the <code>for</code> attribute needs to match the value of the <code>id</code> attribute on the field you want to associate with that <code>label</code>.</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 labeled-field.html embed %}</p>

<p>With that markup in place, the programmatic connection between the elements is made and the results speak for themselves: When you focus the field, the contents of the <code>label</code> are read out.</p>

<h2 id="an-alternate-approach">An Alternate Approach</h2>

<p>Since I specifically referred to this approach as <em>explicit</em> association, you probably assumed that there’s another kind of association. And you were right: <em>implicit</em> association. Implicit association is created by wrapping a form control and its associated label text in a <code>label</code> element. I like to use this approach with radio and checkbox controls:</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 implicitly-labeled-checkbox.html embed %}</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that there’s nothing wrong with explicit association in this context either.</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 explicitly-labeled-checkbox.html embed %}</p>

<p>You can even combine the two approaches.</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 combo-labeled-checkbox.html embed %}</p>

<p>The reason I like to use implicit association with checkbox and radio controls has to do with ensuring the greatest breadth of support when it comes to styling inputs. For instance, if I set <code>width: 80%</code> on all <code>input</code> elements using a simple <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors">type selector</a>, that width would be applied to <em>all</em> <code>input</code> elements, including radio and checkbox controls. In order to prevent radio and checkbox controls from getting rendered at that width, I would need to assign an override value of <code>width: auto</code> to them them specifically. I can do that using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors">attribute selectors</a>:</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 modern-only.css embed %}</p>

<p>While completely valid, that approach leaves out any browsers that don’t support attribute selection (e.g. IE 6). That may not seem like a deal-breaker in your book, but on the off chance some poor soul happens to be stuck using an out-of-date browser (as many are on mobile), I like to show them a little love. And, thankfully, using the implicit markup pattern for checkboxes and radio controls allows for this quite easily: I just use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors">descendent selector</a> instead.</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 universal.css embed %}</p>

<p>This approach results in a greater amount of support and, incidentally, less CSS.</p>

<h2 id="added-benefit-interactivity">Added Benefit: Interactivity</h2>

<p>Obviously, associated labels are great for folks who use screen readers, but they have another benefit: tapping on a <code>label</code> will focus or activate the associated form control.</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-11-11-02" class="media-container"><img src="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-11-11/02.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>Animation showing how clicking a <code>label</code> will focus the associated form control.</figcaption></figure>

<p>This isn’t a game-changer when it comes to standard text fields, but it’s an exceptional affordance when it comes to radio and checkbox controls, especially on mobile, as it vastly increases the tappable region used to activate the control.</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-11-11-03" class="media-container">{% adaptive_image /i/posts/2015-11-11/03.png %}<figcaption>A screenshot of a group of checkbox controls with their labels outlined.</figcaption></figure>

<p>To create incredibly generous tap targets on mobile devices, we can take things a little further. Add padding to the top and bottom of the <code>label</code> to make it bigger and then use negative margins to counter that enlargement and keep the layout as it was before the padding was applied.</p>

<p>{% gist 3585c019108025b2f568 larger-labels.css embed %}</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-11-11-04" class="media-container"><img src="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-11-11/04.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>An animation showing very generous tap targets on a narrow screen.</figcaption></figure>

<p>It’s worth noting that older versions of Internet Explorer only provide the focus/interaction benefit when you use explicit label association. That’s why I like the combo approach of implicit <em>and</em> explicit association for checkbox and radio controls.</p>

<p><ins datetime="2015-12-09" cite="#comment-2374683375">As Dennis Lembrée mentions in the comments below, Dragon’s Naturally Speaking also doesn’t recognize implicit association, which is why it’s incredibly important to use explicit association even if it seems implicit association should suffice.</ins></p>

<h2 id="placeholders-arent-labels">Placeholders Aren’t Labels</h2>

<p>HTML5 ushered in a new option for working with <code>input</code> elements: the <code>placeholder</code> attribute. This declarative attribute makes it possible to offer hint as to the sort of content you were looking for in a field. In <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-placeholder">supporting browsers</a>, it appears in the field, ghosted back a bit, and disappears when you start typing a response.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<figure id="fig-2015-11-11-05" class="media-container"><img src="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/i/posts/2015-11-11/05.gif" alt="" /><figcaption>An animation showing a placeholder in action on <a href="http://webstandardssherpa.com"><cite>Web Standards Sherpa</cite></a>.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Having this natively supported in the browser was a huge boon. For years we’d been using JavaScript to achieve this very effect—albeit typically for label text—in an effort to create more compact forms. Now we get the effect without having to include any additional files or libraries.</p>

<p>Of course, since <code>placeholder</code> implements an existing pattern, it came with baggage. People commonly achieved this effect by (ab)using the <code>value</code> attribute as a fake label. As such, its introduction didn’t do much to increase the accessibility of forms. <em>Form controls need a label</em>. If you want to make your form more compact, you can do that using proper markup and a little clever CSS.</p>

<p>We don’t have a ton of elements in HTML, which is why it’s important that we properly use the ones we do have. Hopefully this has provided a helpful overview of how to properly label form controls using HTML.</p>

    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Browsers typically exhibit two different behaviors here. Some hide the placeholder text as soon as you focus the field, others hide it only when you start typing. Either one works although, admittedly, I favor the text disappearing when you type rather than when the field receives focus. I can see how that approach might confuse some users, I just prefer it because it ensures you see the placeholder. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
