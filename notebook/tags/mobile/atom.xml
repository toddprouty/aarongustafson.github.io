<p>I worked on one project where the client provided me with a spreadsheet detailing 1,400 different user agents that accessed the login screen for the m-dot site. In two days!</p>

<p>As further evidence, consider <a href="http://blog.jasonsamuels.net/post/21633531278/analytics-confirm-the-need-for-adaptive-web-design">the enlightening details of this post from Jason Samuels</a> of the National Council on Family relations, a non-profit organization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2008, Internet Explorer dominated as the browser for 93.5% of their visitors. By 2014, that percentage had fallen to 19.7%, with Chrome bringing in the lion’s share of the traffic (37%). Firefox narrowly beat out IE with a 20% share of users.</li>
  <li>In 2008, visits from “mobile” devices accounted for only about 0.1% of their traffic. In 2014, that number had skyrocketed to 14.4%.</li>
  <li>In 2008, they detected 71 different screen resolutions, which is already a lot to consider. By 2014, however, they were seeing 1,000 unique screen resolutions each and every quarter (with over 200 of those recording 10+ visits per quarter).</li>
</ul>

<p>That last stat blows my mind every time I read it. You can’t design for 200 different screens, let alone 1,000. It’s a fools errand. And don’t even think of trying to test on that many devices.</p>

<p>And yet, here we are designing websites that can (and will) go anywhere. We need to thoroughly test because we can’t make any assumptions about the browsers and devices being used to access our content.</p>

<p>Testing can be tedious, time consuming, and costly. Surely there’s a way to make it easier. There sure is: Instead of getting hung up on creating one experience that needs to be nearly identical on every browser, we can be smarter about how we build things and treat experience as a continuum.</p>

<p>We can build websites that are both nimble enough to work on low powered devices over slow networks <em>and</em> smart enough to take advantage of advanced features and sensors when opportunity knocks.</p>

<p><em>Wha?! We can have our cake and eat it too</em>? Yes. Yes we can.</p>

<h2 id="start-on-solid-footing">Start on Solid Footing</h2>

<p>When dealing with the insane proliferation of web-enabled devices and the great unknown of where our websites will go, it pays to take a step back and focus on what’s important. We need to ask ourselves two simple questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the purpose of this page, this form, this interface?</li>
  <li>What is the simplest way to realize that purpose?</li>
</ol>

<p>Then we need to build that <em>first</em>. Typically we’re talking text, some basic HTML, actual links to other pages, and forms that submit to a back-end of some sort. This is our minimum viable product and it will work anywhere.</p>

<p>Then we can look for opportunities to enhance the experience, all while keeping that functional core at the center of the experience.</p>

<p>We can use CSS to add visual hierarchy to the page, provide some visual interest, and adjust the layout to create a good reading experience on a wide range of screen sizes. We should start from the narrowest screen size we can imagine and <a href="https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/191977076000161793">let the content guide our breakpoint decisions</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll use JavaScript to give real-time feedback to our users. <a href="http://domscripting.com/presentations/xtech2006/">We’ll hijack forms and links</a> to <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax-includes-modular-content.html">lazy load additional content</a> or otherwise avoid full-page refreshes. Heck, we can even take over the entire page and <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/">convert it into a single page app</a>.</p>

<p>But we should never sacrifice the functional core.</p>

<p>This approach to designing for the web is called <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a> and it’s the number one tool for dealing with the one-two punch of older browsers and device proliferation.</p>

<h2 id="be-conservative-in-your-delivery">Be Conservative in Your Delivery</h2>

<p>What makes progressive enhancement so helpful when it comes to dealing with this swirling mass of devices and browsers is that the core experience will <em>always be</em> available. There is nothing precluding our users from accessing it, even on a crappy WAP browser or a text-based browser like Lynx or even some <a href="http://www.theubi.com/">no so far-future talking computer</a> that only “sees” the web as text.</p>

<p>In order to ensure we don’t accidentally deliver advanced features to less capable browsers like these, we just need to be smart about how we load stuff like CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Some basic CSS—think typography, color, etc.—will be usable by just about anyone, so we can put all that stuff in one CSS file (e.g., <code>basic.css</code>) and include it with a standard <code>link</code>. Then we can tuck all of our layout rules and other advanced CSS into a separate CSS file (e.g., <code>advanced.css</code>) that we link to with an associated media query.</p>

<p>Any <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bryanrieger/rethinking-the-mobile-web-by-yiibu/106">browsers that don’t understand media queries will ignore the second CSS file entirely</a> and receive only the linear, mobile view. Easy peasy, and IE8 gets the mobile layout (a baseline level of support that is not likely to cause you any testing headaches).</p>

<p>You can even take things a step further and use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports">the <code>@supports</code> block</a> within <code>advanced.css</code> to limit certain rule sets to only the browsers that support specific CSS features.</p>

<p>Of course, CSS support issues are nothing compared to JavaScript, so sometimes it’s best not to deliver certain bits of JavaScript-based functionality to browsers that can’t handle it. This is where <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html">feature (and object) detection</a> becomes incredibly useful:</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment#Downlevel-revealed_conditional_comment">inverted conditional comments</a> to prohibit older versions of IE from getting JavaScript in the first place (which means you don’t even need to worry about debugging JavaScript there). Here’s an example that hides <code>main.js</code> from IE8 and below, but makes it available to IE9 on up and to every other non-IE browser.</p>

<p>By being conservative in what we deliver to browsers we <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/">ensure the greatest level of support, but can still optimize for more advanced ones</a>. This makes testing so much easier because we know older browsers will be okay with the basics and we aren’t trying to use JavaScript features unless we know they’re available.</p>

<h2 id="test-test-test">Test, Test, Test</h2>

<p>Progressive enhancement helps us avoid a lot of rendering and scripting issues before we even get to the testing phase of a project, but eventually we do need to sit down and run our projects through their paces.</p>

<p>In order to keep testing manageable during development, it’s best to test in one browser we know to have good web standards support. It will provide a basic gut-check for our work. Once we are pretty confident things are working as they should be, we can begin more thorough testing on a variety of browsers and devices.</p>

<p>I personally keep several versions of each major browser on my laptop at any given time. I work on a Mac, so I typically have a few versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera lying around. You can get older versions of these browsers here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-continuous/index.html">Chromium Archive</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/">Firefox Archive</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/download//?custom=yes">Opera Archive</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s near-impossible to get older versions of Safari running on modern versions of OS X, so I typically just have the latest version locally.</p>

<p>For testing on Windows versions of said browsers, I typically have anywhere from 3-5 virtual machines running various Windows versions with their associated browser version and (typically) a copy of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera for good measure. The MS Edge Dev site offers <a href="http://dev.modern.ie/tools/vms/">free Windows VMs for download</a>. If you’re just looking to get a gut-check in the latest and greatest from Microsoft, there’s also <a href="https://remote.modern.ie/">the Remote.IE service</a>, which allows you to connect to a virtualized version of the browser.</p>

<p>If you develop on Windows or Linux, you’ll need access to a Mac or you’ll have to rely on virtualization to test on that platform. I’ll discuss virtualization in a moment.</p>

<p>Once you’ve thoroughly tested in the various desktop browsers, it’s time to take the deep dive into the world of devices. If you’re unsure where to begin, take a look at your analytics, but take them with a grain of salt. Analytics can lead you to make false assumptions. For example, if you see a low percentage of Blackberry users, could that be because your site just doesn’t work well in Blackberry so they don’t stick around (or come back)? Beware the self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>If you have the budget, by all means pick up some devices to have on hand for testing. You can use tools like <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/inspect">Adobe’s Edge Inspect</a>, <a href="http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/">Vanamco’s Ghostlab</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/viljamis/Remote-Preview">Viljami Salminen’s Remote Preview</a> (or a combination of all of the above) to synchronize browsing on a handful of devices. Some of these tools also allow for remote inspection of the device to debug CSS and JavaScript. <a href="http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre-docs/latest/">Weinre</a> (which Adobe Edge Inspect uses) and <a href="http://vorlonjs.com/">Vorlon.js</a> also provide remote inspection functionality.</p>

<p>If you are lucky enough to have one nearby, you should stop by your local <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">open device lab (ODL)</a> to run your tests. ODLs are free community resources, typically offered by a web design studio or an individual who happens to be sitting on a ton of devices. Someone at the ODL should be able to help you pick out devices to test on and introduce you to the testing tools they have available in the lab.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an ODL nearby, you can also do some guerrilla-style testing in your local mobile phone or electronics store. Just make sure they have real devices… you won’t get far on the fake plastic ones.</p>

<p>If none of these are options for you, there’s always virtualization. You can download and install <a href="http://www.mobilexweb.com/emulators">emulators for a variety of mobile browsers and devices</a>. Additionally, services like <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/">Browserstack</a> and <a href="http://crossbrowsertesting.com/">CrossBrowserTesting</a> offer access to hundreds of virtual desktops and devices for a nominal fee.</p>

<p>Virtualization will never give you the same experience as holding a real device in your hand. The performance is rarely the same and you don’t get any sort of feel for how the device responds to your input. I once stumbled on an Android 2.3 bug wherein generated content was being re-generated and re-inserted every time the device was rotated. I doubt I would have discovered that using an emulator. That said, emulators can help you get a rough idea of whether your interface works or not.</p>

<p>Regardless of the means by which you procure your testing devices, try to cover a good cross-section. Pick some low-end ones, a couple older high-end devices, and handful of the latest flagships, and a wide variety of screen sizes and resolutions. Make sure you have good coverage in terms of operating systems too—the latest iOS and Android versions are a given, but make sure you have a Windows device or two, a few Blackberry options, and some older Android and iOS versions in the mix. Then throw in <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2013/microsoft-kin-resurfaces-25-daily-deals-site/">an oddball</a> <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/have-39-spare-then-pick-odd-sylvania-7-netbook-windows-ce">or two</a> to see if your interfaces hold up.</p>

<p>It’s important to bear in mind that we will never be able to give each user on each device exactly the same experience. We need to be okay with that—experience is a continuum. As long as our users can accomplish what they need to on our sites, they will be well-served.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-points-embrace-patterns">Bonus Points: Embrace Patterns</h2>

<p>If we really want to make things easy on ourselves (and our team), we should consider building a <a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/getting-started-with-pattern-libraries">pattern library</a> before we build a single page of our website.</p>

<p>Breaking our interfaces down into discrete, repeatable patterns (e.g., a label and form control, a tabbed interface, etc.) lets us look at each in isolation and test it that way too. Testing in isolation is far easier than trying to debug a page with a lot of moving parts.</p>

<p>Gathering our patterns into a live, web-based pattern library  allows anyone on our team to collect the patterns they need to build a given interface as easily as they’d assemble a plate at a smörgåsbord. And if we really want to streamline the building and testing process, we can even <a href="http://ianfeather.co.uk/a-maintainable-style-guide/">make the patterns importable into the live site</a> so everything stays in sync.</p>

<h2 id="dont-fear-the-zombie-apocalypse">Don’t Fear the Zombie Apocalypse</h2>

<p>With the constant onslaught of new devices, form factors, and considerations, it’s tempting to throw up our hands and find another line of work. The pace of advancement is so brisk, it’s just hard to keep up, let alone feel like we’re on top of where things are headed.</p>

<p>Thankfully, however, all is not lost. By taking a step back and focusing on what matters, embracing experience as a continuum, and being deliberate in how (and when) we deliver certain features and functionality to browsers, we’ll head most issues off at the pass.</p>

<p>This relieves some of the pressure (and frustration) from the testing process and frees us up to test on a wider variety of devices and browsers, which means we’ll be able to provide a solid experience for more users, no matter what marvel of technological wizardry they happen to be using at the time.</p>

<p>Everybody wins.</p>

<h2 id="embrace-mobile-first-css">1. Embrace mobile-first CSS</h2>

<p>This is a quick win. I’ve done the mobile-first overhaul on a number of existing sites over the last few years and the best strategy I’ve found is this:</p>

  <li>Create two CSS files. Name the first something like “basic.css” and link to it with <code>media="all"</code>. Name the second something like “advanced.css” and link to it with <code>media="only screen"</code>.</li>
  <li>Move all of your existing desktop-only CSS into advanced.css and wrap the rules in a media query corresponding to your design width (e.g. <code>@media (min-width:60em)</code> for a 960px max width).</li>
  <li>Open a page from your site in a new browser window and make it as small as possible. Move any basic typographic and color styles from advanced.css to default.css and refresh the page. How does it look? Make the browser wider. Still acceptable? Awesome! This is the CSS you’ll serve to older browsers that don’t understand media queries and it forms the basis of your larger screen styles.</li>
  <li>Shrink the browser back down to the smallest it can go and create a breakpoint for that size in advanced.css (e.g. <code>@media (min-width:10.5em)</code> if you want to small target devices like the <a href="https://getpebble.com/">Pebble</a>). Move any styles you want applied in this scenario from your “full screen” breakpoint and add any new rules you need to make things look good.</li>
  <li>Increase the browser width until the layout looks odd, then make a new breakpoint and move in or add the necessary styles.</li>
  <li>Rinse &amp; repeat until you get up to the “full screen” layout.</li>
  <li>Move your print styles—you do have print styles, right?—into default.css and wrap them in a print <code>@media</code> block.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="focus-on-key-tasks">2. Focus on key tasks</h2>

<p>Every page has a purpose. If it doesn’t, you don’t need it. Find the page’s purpose and make that the focus. Eliminate distractions and reduce the amount of friction a user encounters when trying to accomplish the task.</p>

<p>If company or client politics preclude you from getting rid of all distractions on a page, consider <a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/ajax-includes-modular-content.html">a lazy-loading strategy</a> to bring them in with JavaScript only when there is more screen real estate.</p>

<h2 id="get-smarter-about-images">3. Get smarter about images</h2>

<p>Images are great, but they often comprise the majority of a web page’s bulk. To slim things down, first consider whether a given image is actually needed. If it isn’t, get rid of it. If it offers an enhancement, but isn’t crucial, consider lazy-loading it after page load. If the image is really important, <a href="https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/">use <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code></a> (or the <code>picture</code> element) to deliver the smallest and yet most appropriate image to your users, based on their device.</p>

<h2 id="embrace-the-continuum">4. Embrace the continuum</h2>

<p>As designers and developers, we often try to control everything. But we have to realize that we can’t control everything on the Web. People on different devices have different capabilities and considerations. They will need your website to be flexible enough to allow them to accomplish their goals no matter what.</p>

<p>Understanding that is key to building experiences that move seamlessly across devices. You know, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement">progressive enhancement</a>. It’s key to embracing the Web for all of its inherent web-iness.</p>

<p>And there you have it: 4 simple, but effective guidelines for creating awesome websites that will fair well under Google’s new algorithm. And guess what: Your users will benefit too.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-15T11:58:11-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/an-onslaught-of-low-cost-smartphones</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems every week we are seeing more and more low-cost devices being launched in an effort to connect the unconnected. For instance, this past week  saw the announcement of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/14/7544107/microsoft-lumia-435-532-launch-specs-price-release-date">two new entries in the Microsoft Lumia line, the 435 and the 532</a>, and the announcement of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/samsung-finally-puts-tizen-on-a-smartphone-launches-the-z1-in-india/">Samsung’s first Tizen phone, the Z1</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The two Lumia devices are the cheapest Windows Phone offerings to date: The Lumia 435 is €69 (about US$80) and the Lumia 532 is just slightly more expensive at €79 (about US$94). By comparison, the Lumia 535 was the previous low-cost Windows Phone winner at US$135. And Samsung’s Z1, which is aimed at the Indian market, runs a mere Rs 5,700 (roughly US$92).</p>

<p>Now if you’ve read this far, you are probably wondering why this matters. Well, spec-wise, many of these lower-end devices are far from what we are used to. All of these devices are running a resolution of 800×480. And their processing speeds are slower than the device you likely have in your pocket. But they are all far cheaper too. And remember that people in China and India have <a href="#fig-2015-01-15-01">far less disposible income than we do</a>.</p>

<figure id="fig-2015-01-15-01" class="media-container">

</figure>

<p>If you only earned US$295 a month, a US$799 smartphone would likely be out of the question.</p>

<p>As Web designers and developers, we need to expose ourselves to the Web as others see it. This is why we need to view our sites and applications on lower-end devices and over lower-speed—2G, 3G, etc.—connections. Only by testing our wares can we truly ensure our content and services are available and accessible by anyone, anywhere, on any device. You know, <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/">the vision for the Web</a>.</p>

<p>Of course you probably don’t have the budget to purchase a bunch of devices, no matter how cheap they are. So how do you test on them? <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">Visit a local Open Device Lab</a> like <a href="http://chadevicelab.org">the one we have here in Chattanooga</a>. Or if you don’t have one near you, consider getting together with some colleagues and <a href="http://lab-up.org/">starting an ODL in your area</a>.</p>

    <link href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/native-vs-stylable-tug-of-war/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-17T08:21:47-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/native-vs-stylable-tug-of-war</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his astute post <a href="//www.brucelawson.co.uk/2014/native-experience-vs-styling-select-boxes/">“‘Native experience’ vs styling select boxes”</a>, Bruce Lawson correctly identified a common tension in the web world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But why this urge to re-style page elements that end-users are familiar with? … Or is it that we love native look and feel, except when we don’t?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking as the guy who not only wrote JavaScript to help me create an accessible <code>select</code> element alternative, but who also made it <a href="http://d1b14unh5d6w7g.cloudfront.net/1590598563.01.S0ER.LXXXXXXX.jpg?Expires=1405686346&amp;Signature=DCT4Z0l75JQESDNyP0PVGVonuJYwY9XYtaTI3grX/RhdlLcXGRAVADJCB/N/fAj7GxLhEVzuXqstMebJIJ9Ip5I6kE7IKYt2F20F5EGD+1ghua9zKwyjS1e4KBgumMKzQytbcfIVX4dMr7XFzj26mScFKz9bSKtZT5jU1LU6hWM=&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUO27P366FGALUMQ">the focus of a case study (image)</a> in <a href="http://amzn.to/TaoffD">AdvancED DOM Scripting</a>, I am fully aware of the desire to have it both ways. I have not often seen the desire for both in a single individual, but it does happen in one particular instance occasionally.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Based on my own experience, I see the following arguments in favor of changing the display of a native control quite often:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It doesn’t look good to me.</li>
  <li>It is not “on brand”.</li>
  <li>It clashes with our brand’s color scheme.</li>
  <li>We want the web experience to feel like a native app.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t behave how we think it should.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>(<abbr lang="it" title="nota bene: please note">n.b.</abbr> Browsers have done a pretty good job reducing the amount of color and the overall visual strength used in native controls to help them better blend in with a wide variety of designs, so clashes as mentioned in #3 happen far less often than they did nearly a decade ago.)</em></p>

<p>As the weathered, battle tested (and, admittedly, somewhat jaded) front-end dev that I am, I typically push back with one or more of the following:</p>

<h2 id="in-addressing-desired-design-changes">In Addressing Desired Design Changes</h2>

<p>In terms of aesthetics (addressing arguments 1, 2, and 3), I understand where you’re coming from. Native controls are not the most appealing things, but they are familiar to your users. A <code>select</code> box they see on your site that looks like the one they see on Wikipedia or their banking site will be immediately recognizable. Sure, the looks and feel may differ from browser to browser, but most people use only a small number of browsers throughout the day—at work, at home, on their device—and if you want to ensure the design of a form control feels “right” in the browser they are using, sometimes it’s best to let go of that control.</p>

<h2 id="in-addressing-os-parity">In Addressing OS Parity</h2>

<p>I can understand the desire to have a form control in a web page look and feel like the same (or a similar) control within the native operating system (argument 4), but I am not sure that’s a rabbit hole you want to go down. Here’s why: Achieving exact design and functional parity between a native control and a web control quite often requires extra markup, a bunch of CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Anything is achievable with unlimited time and budget, so it’s completely doable, but it would be good to estimate the cost to see if you still think it is a worthwhile endeavor.</p>

<p>Assuming it is, we then have the question of which operating system to model the control after. Or maybe you want to offer a different take on the control based on the operating system your user is using. In that case, we may need to multiply the original estimate by the number of operating systems you want to support. But it’s worth noting that, in the Android world, different device manufacturers often “skin” the operating system to look different from other ones. Sometimes they even do it on a device-by-device basis. We’ll need to figure out which ones you want to include in your native control matrix and multiply the estimate accordingly.</p>

<p>Then there’s maintenance. We’ll need to test these native-like controls on each of their corresponding platforms and test the script that determines which experience gets delivered to which device to make sure we’re not accidentally sending the wrong experience. We’ll also need to test the delivery script on every other browser in our test matrix to ensure it is not causing issues there.</p>

<p>What should we do when a new operating system version is rolled out? iOS, for example, has made radical shifts in the design of their native controls in each major release. We’ll probably want to create unique versions of the control for each version of each OS we support and we’ll need to keep tabs on upgrades so we don’t end up confusing our users if they visit our site in iOS 7 and have a control that looks like it’s from iOS 6. We’ll need to add the number of OS versions into the multiplier as well.</p>

<p>Ok, and finally: How many controls did you want to apply this approach to again?</p>

<p>Or we could use the native form control and it will just work.</p>

<h2 id="in-addressing-altered-behavior">In Addressing Altered Behavior</h2>

<p>I completely agree that not all native controls work exactly how I would like, but there are several risks in changing the expected behavior of a native control.</p>

<p>First of all, there’s the possibility we could actually end up making the interface more confusing or that the change in behavior might not be exactly what our user’s wanted (either based on what they are used to or our mental model not aligning with theirs). In order to rule out these issues, we should run a few rounds of usability tests. These could be quick café tests or more formal studies depending on the budget.</p>

<p>Assuming our tests go well, we will need to maintain this code and do all of the requisite browser testing. And potentially upgrade our code as new browsers and browser versions come out. Depending on the complexity of the code, this could become a large requirement, but if it is ultimately in the service of making the web a better, more usable interaction environment, it could be worth it.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, if we go this route and are successful, we should consider getting involved in the spec-writing process at the <a href="//w3.org">W3C</a> or  <a href="//whatwg.org">WhatWG</a>. We should contribute our recommended changes back to the community and share what we learned. If we make a compelling argument, perhaps our idea will become part of some future standard and we can taper off our browser testing when the change goes native.</p>

<hr />

<p>As you can probably tell, I’m not a really big fan of changing existing controls as I feel it can amount to a wasted effort. That said, if there are design improvements to be made—“design” in the true sense: being about how usable something is, not just how aesthetically-pleasing it is to someone (e.g. improving contrast, making the control more intuitive, etc.)—I’m willing to accept the change as something we <em>should</em> do and then work to make sure that change has been vetted and, if successful, given away for inclusion in other projects. If it solves a major issue on the web, I want to give that change every opportunity to make it into the appropriate spec by talking to the appropriate folks about it both in-person, in blog posts, and on the appropriate mailing list. If the change solves a problem in a specific browser, I want to see it incorporated into said browser and will file a bug report and try to build momentum around it by engaging the community.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s my general position on augmenting native controls. What are your thoughts on the topic?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/what-a-stalling-tablet-market-says-about-our-search-for-the-perfect-screen/">recent piece from <cite>Wired</cite></a> attributes dwindling tablet sales to cannibalization from larger mobile phones (<abbr title="also known as">aka</abbr> “phablets”) which are nearly as big as 7-8˝ tablets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aside from the ability to make a phone call, the difference between a phone and a tablet comes down to 1.5 inches or less. … But the real issue is device makers are running out of good arguments for why these ever more subtle size gradations matter. After a point, the differences come down to personal preference rather than any meaningful new use case. As phones and tablets converge into this tight window, slightly bigger phones could accelerate the decline in tablet demand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I’m not sure it matters. We’re in the midst of one big experiment being run by the device manufacturers. We’re in the scattershot. The industry is feeling out the “right” screen size (or sizes) that most people want to use and we are (in large part) footing the bill.</p>
